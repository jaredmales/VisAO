/** \page adc_adjustment Adjusting The ADC
 * \ingroup operators_users_guide

The atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) often needs to be adjusted, especially at the beginning of the night.

\note The ADC is common to  VisAO and the Pyramid WFS. It can impart a significant tilt on the wavefront, possibly opening the loop.  In closed-loop, the maximum adjustment that should be made in one step is 4 degrees.

If the ADC needs to be adjusted (see the above figure), follow these steps:
-# Place F/W 2 in open and F/W 3 in open
-# Take RT dark and apply dark subtraction on imviewer
-# Go to log scale and bone color table (these seem to work best for Jared)
-# open WFS hw gui (use WFS S/W link on Vizzy desktop)
-# select "ADC hi-level"
\image html ug_adc_adjustment.png "The WFS hs gui with ADC hi-level selected.  The delta dispersion angle is set to 4, with a new value of 8 about to be set."
\note steps of 4 degrees are completely safe in closed loop.  Do not use steps bigger than this.
-# Adjust "delta dispersion angle"
   -  Typical beginning of the night values are 8-12 degrees total  
   - anywhere from 0 to 16 has been found at various times
   
-# When the image looks like the good PSF shown below, close the WFS hw gui and take data.
