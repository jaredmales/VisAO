\section flat_field_2014A Flat Field

Morning sky flats were found to be much better than evening sky flats.  The direction that sunlight enters the dome in the evening causes significant glinting which does not appear to be as bad in the morning.  Even in the morning, the illumination pattern is such that the resultant flat is only useful for high spatial frequency response (i.e. pixel to pixel), and some glinting is still visible with a sufficiently large smoothing kernel.

These flats were taken on the morning of 2014 Apr 18 UT, in the 50/50 beamsplitter and the z' filter.  Exposure time was adjusted as the sky brightened to avoid saturation.

The following steps were taken to form the flat:

- images were selected to have the same filter combination
- images were selected to have no digitally saturated pixels (16383 ADU)
- images were bias subtracted using a 2.273s bias frame.  darks at other exposure times were not taken.
- an offset remained between the biases of the two amplifiers.  this was corrected in each image by adding a constant to the bottom half so that medians of the rows on either side of the amplifier boundary were equal.
- next each image was median smoothed with an odd-pixel sized boxcar
- then each image was divided by the smoothed version of itself
- the images were then combined with a 3-sigma clipped mean

The choice of smoothing width affects the quality of the flat under the dust spots, which are of order 20 pixels wide, and it affects the rejection of mid-spatial frequency glints.  By comparing a flat with an 11 and a flat with a 41 pixel smoothing width, we found that the major glint (which becomes visible in the 41 pixel flat) only raises the apparent response by ~0.2%.  In contrast, the 11 pixel flat overstates the response under large dust spots by up to 1%.  We recommend using the 41 pixel flat, but several choices (11,21,31, 41) are provided.  A simple ratio of these images will allow you to analyze the tradeoffs.

Note that the ~10 pixels at the edge of the flats should not be used, as smoothing is suspect there.

The VisAO camera pixel response is flat to better than 1%, with the exceptions of dust spots.  Some statistics of the 41 pixel flat are given below.  For these we excluded 10 pixels at the edge of the array where the smoothing is less effective.

\section ND_2014A ND Calibration

The ND was calibrated during 2014A on HD 84687 a V~7 F3V star.  The following table gives the results.
\note These should be used for observation planning only.  Contact the VisAO team for more up to date ND information.  

\note You should plan ND calibrations if you expect to use it for your observations.
