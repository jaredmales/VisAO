This GUI allows you to control the VisAO Filter Wheels (a.k.a. Filter Wheel 2 and Filter Wheel 3).

For normal operations you can select the filter name from the dropdown list, and press Go. Pressing HOME causes a home sequence to execute.  STOP will abort motion at any time.

You can also move in absolute positions and relative to the current position.  Positions are specified in whole filters.
