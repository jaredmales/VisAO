This is the user's guide to the Gimbal GUI.

The current position is indicated on the right.

To move the gimbal mirror, you can use the arrow keys.  Tapping the keys for a short period of time causes a move based on the length of time the arrow key was pressed.  After a certain amount of time (usually about 1 second, but this is tuned for responsiveness) a slew starts that will last until you release the arrow key.  In any case, a move will not continue after you have released the arrow key.

The STOP button will stop a move in progress started from the New X or New Y GO buttons.  To specify an absolute position in X or Y, enter it in the relevant box and press GO.

The Center button will return the Gimbal to the pre-programmed center position, where the closed-loop spot should be near the center of the CCD47 in the 50/50 beamsplitter.
