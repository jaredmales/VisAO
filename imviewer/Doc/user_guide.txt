This is the user's guide to the VisAO imviewer, the real time image viewer.

\section imviewer_mainwin Main Window
The main window

Control over several options is provided via the main window.  The zoom level can be changed using the mouse wheel (note that this works opposite to the ds9 convention, VisAO flies like an airplane).  The view center can be changed by center-clicking on the desired location, or using the sliders.  The arrow button in the lower left corner hides/shows the bottom row of gages and buttons.  Most of these functions have keyboard shortcuts, listed below.

Along the bottom the x-y coordinate of the mouse pointer, and the pixel value at that point are displayed.  The age of the current image (how long it has been displayed) and the average frame rate are also shown.

The re-scale button adjusts the color bar scale using the current image.  The Panel button launches the control panel, and the Stop button freezes real-time updating of the display.
 
\section imviewer_conpan Control Panel
The control panel provides detailed control over various imviewer settings.  It can be launched by pressing the "Panel" button on the main window, or by pressing p in the main window.  The following sections and figures describe the various functions of the control panel.

<h4>The View Tab</h4>
The View tab provides control over the zoom level, the center of view, and also provides numerical details and a finer view based on the mouse cursor position.

Zoom can be changed by pressing one of the zoom buttons, with the slider, typing in the box below the buttons, by changing the Width or Height using W and H fields, or by pressing a number from 1-9.  The center of view can be changed using the X and Y fields, or by using the arrow buttons.  The current zoom and center is indicated by the cross and box in the zoom view at left.  At right is the mouse pointer view which shows the region under the mouse cursor at an additional zoom.  Under the view the coordinate and pixel value of the mouse cursor are shown.  The pointer view can be fixed in a certain location by first pressing the Set Location button, then left clicking in the main window at the desired location."


<h4>The Color Tab</h4>
The Color tab provides control over display colors, including the scale, bias, contrast, and the color map.

The Mode drop-down box gives the following choices:
<ul>
<li> <b>Min/Max Global</b> The scale minimum and maximum are set based on the whole image</li>
<li> <b>Min/Max View</b> The scale minimum and maximum are set based on the current view (not implemented)</li>
<li> <b>Min/Max Box</b> The scale minimum and maximum are set based on the color box</li>
<li> <b>User</b> The scale minimum and maximum are set by the user</li>
</ul>
The user can change the scale min and max by right clicking and dragging (as in ds9), or by adjusting the appropriate slider or directly entering the desired values in the relevant boxes.

The scale type dictates how the color map is assigned to image values.  The Type drop-down box gives the following choices:
<ul>
<li><b>Linear</b></li>
<li><b>Log</b></li>
<li><b>Power</b></li>
<li><b>Square Root</b></li>
<li><b>Squared</b></li>
</ul>

The choice of color bar dictates the colors of the image display.  The Color Bar drop-down box gives the following choices:
<ul>
<li><b>Grey</b></li>
<li><b>Jet</b></li>
<li><b>Hot</b></li>
<li><b>Bone</b></li>
<li><b>Red</b></li>
<li><b>Green</b></li>
<li><b>Blue</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>The Setup Tab</h4>

The Setup Tab provides control over several options.

The behavior of the pointer view (visible in the View Tab) can be changed to trade-off between responsiveness and speed.  The pointer view drop-down offers the following choices:
<ul>
<li><b>Enabled</b> will cause the pointer view to always display the data under the mouse cursor</li>
<li><b>On Mouse Press</b> will cause the pointer view to only display data when the mouse is left clicked.  This should be selected if high frame rates are desired, and is the default</li>
<li><b>Disabled</b> causes the pointer view to never display data</li>
</ul>

The check box controls whether the zoom view is updated with every image.  The default is unchecked, and should be the choice when performance is important.

The stats box button controls whether the red statistics box is visible and the attendant stats window is shown.

The image get timeout controls the length of time that imviewer pauses before checking for a new image in the shared memory circular buffer.  This should normally be short (20 ms is the default) to provide responsiveness in high frame rates.

\section imviewer_statsbox Statistics Box

The statistics box is a tool for calculating and displaying some statistics about a region of the image in real time.  These stats are calculated in a separate thread, and so update as soon as they are calculated, but may not be perfectly synchronized with the display.  This is especially true for if the stats box is large.  The stats are displayed numerically in the Stats Panel, and some of them can be plotted as a time series.

\image html imv_stats_box.png "The Stats Panel shows several statistical quantities.  For select quantities, a real time plot can be launched showing a short history."

\image latex imv_stats_box.eps "The Stats Panel shows several statistical quantities.  For select quantities, a real time plot can be launched showing a short history."

The Stats Panel currently shows the latest value of the minimum, maximum, mean, and median.  A 2D Gaussian is also continually fit to the data, and the resultant best fit peak value, FWHM, ellipticity, angle of the major axis, and the background level are displayed.

\image html imv_stats_plot.png "The Stats Plot shows a time series of the selected quantity.  The sliders allow adjusting the associated axis scale."

\image latex imv_stats_plot.eps "The Stats Plot shows a time series of the selected quantity.  The sliders allow adjusting the associated axis scale."

The stats plot shows a real-time updating time series of the selected quantity.  Along the y-axis, the left slider adjusts the y-axis maximum, and the right slider adjusts the minimum.  Along the x-axis the slider adjusts the time maximum.  The time minimum is always zero.

\section imviewer_colors Color Bar

The selected color bar defines what colors are mapped to the intensity levels in the image data.  In the future the available color bars will be listed here, with illustrations.
