X CCD47: test simple_take vs simplest_take, is it the device name issue? (done 4 Nov 2010)
   11/1/2010 - it appears to be a problem with DALSA_2CH_INTLV setting in cfg.  Email sent to cliff at EDT.
   11/2/2010 - solved with help from EDT, have to use setdebug workaround

- develop EDT startup system, including setdebug -k 0 (?) 
   11/6/2010 - it appears the setdebug -k 0 won't work, have to use -k c 
             - this causes a need to flush the first N buffers (e.g. 4)
				 - need to work out timing implications of this, does this mean we lose data?

X CCD47: learn how to upload the 2nd file (done 4 Nov 2010)
  using VisAOJoeCtrl

- CCD47: design configuration changing system for CCD47
  Need to add EDT cfg facility to the JoeCtrl config file.
  VisAOJoeCtrl will then initcam when necessary.
  
- CCD47: check how JoeCtrl deals with blank program spots

- CCD47: change ccd47 gui so it handles binning and speed as single program selections.

X Put visao conf directory under version control

- Focus stage GUI: separate position and go-to input boxes.

- imviewer: - develop grabbable boxes
            - implement relative scales
            - add log scale
            - troubleshoot disappearing zoom view - may be take47
